This repository contains data and code supporting:

<a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)01355-6">Bang et al. (2023) “Noradrenaline tracks emotional modulation of attention in human amygdala” Current Biology</a>

Figure_X.m scripts will generate the specified plots and associated statistical analyses.

Note that some scripts may use the name "norepinephrine (NE)" instead of "noradrenaline (NA)". 

The paths in these scripts require editing "Functions/getBase.m" to point to your local version of the repository.

The scripts relating to pupil-NA coupling (Figure4.m and Figure S4.m) use the input and output files for the HMM analysis for simplicity. An accompanying HMM tutorial for the paper can be found <a href="https://github.com/Beniamino92/mvHMM/tree/main/HMM-NE-pupil-IAPS-oddball">here</a>.
